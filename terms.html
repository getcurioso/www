      <p>
        Upon termination, certain provisions of these Terms will continue to apply, including those regarding

      </p>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of card data, set information, price estimates, or any user

      </p>
      <p>
        Our total aggregate liability for any claim related to the Service shall be limited to the amount you paid (if

        minimum amount permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
