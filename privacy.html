      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> such as username, email address (if provided), and password.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile & Collection Data:</strong> cards you add to your collection or wishlist, binders you create,
          notes, card conditions, and other details you choose to store.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketplace & Social Features:</strong> listings you create, messages you send to other users,
          likes or interactions with binders, and other user-generated content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> interactions with the app or website, such as pages visited, features used,
          and in-app actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> device type, operating system, app version, language, and
          approximate region.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies & Similar Technologies (Website):</strong> we may use cookies and similar technologies to
          analyze traffic, remember preferences, and improve your experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Our website may use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics or similar services) to understand
        how visitors use the site. These tools collect information such as pages visited, time spent on
        pages, and general device information. This data is aggregated and does not directly identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Camera & Media Access</h3>
      <p>
        The Curio TCG mobile app may request permission to access your device camera and/or photos/media when
        you choose to take or upload card images. Access is optional and only used for the purposes described
        below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Taking photos:</strong> to capture card images directly from the app for adding to your
          collection or listings.</li>
        <li><strong>Uploading photos:</strong> to select existing images from your device to attach to your
          collection items or marketplace listings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Images you choose to upload are treated as User Content. Uploaded images may be stored on our servers
        or a third-party content delivery network (CDN) to provide the Service, and may be resized or processed
        for performance and display purposes. You control the visibility of uploaded images through your
        account settings and can request deletion by contacting <a href="mailto:support@curiotcg.app">support@curiotcg.app</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Camera and media permissions are only used when you explicitly grant them and perform an action that
        requires them. Curio TCG does not collect camera images or media in the background and does not access
        your device photos unless you initiate an upload or take a photo within the app. You can revoke
        permissions at any time via your device settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-party providers (for example, CDN or moderation services) may process uploaded images as part of
        hosting, delivery or moderation; see the "How We Share Your Information" section for details about
        third-party processors.
      </p>
